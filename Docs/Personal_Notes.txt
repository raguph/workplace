DevOps:

The DevOps tools can be categorized in seven groups depending on its purpose in the particular stage of DevOps lifecycle:

    Code (Version Control System): Git
    Build (Continuous Integration): Jenkins, Travis, TeamCity
    Test (Continuous testing, inspection): JMeter, Sonarqube
    Package (Artifact repository): Artifactory
    Configure & Release ( Change management, containerization ): Docker Compose
    Infrastructure ( Orchestration, cloud ): Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos, AWS, Gcloud, Nexus
    Monitor ( Manage the performance): ELK, Grafana

One of the benefits of use an artifact repository (Nexus, Jfrog Artifactory..) with Jenkins(or another CI tool like Bamboo) is that you can deploy your artifacts to a repository in Nexus(or Artifactory) with their control version (include SNAPSHOT in maven) previously to send these artifacts to each environment (integration environment, production environment...).
